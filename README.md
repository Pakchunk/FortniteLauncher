  At the moment, FortniteLauncher is semi broken.
  <br />
  Ever since the 16.40 update, you can go in lobby and avoid the game being closed by clicking outside of the box instead of the confirm button, but no matter what after around 20-30 seconds, the game will close automatically.
  <br />
  <br />
  This launcher will likely be completely patched in a future update, when that happens, this repository will become archived and no support will be given for this.

<p align="center">
Simple Fortnite launcher which bypasses EAC and allows for dll injection, it also allows for efficiently using Epic's services on older builds!
